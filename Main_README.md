#This README includes two Project details -
1. DeFi Vault
2. Decentralized Governance

I did these two project as an induction task for GDG club's Blockchain Division.

#1 . Decentralized or DeFi Vault -
Introduction - It is a vault designed for users to securely withdraw or transfer their ETH Deposits.
Features - 
1. It has appropriate functions to allow user to send ETH to the contract.
2. The contract can track individual deposits using mapping.
3. It has appropriate functions to allow user to withdraw a certain amount of ETH from their specific deposited amount.
4. The user cannot access more amount than the available balance at his deposit.
5. Ensures the user's balance is updated in the mapping before funds are transferred to mitigate potential re-entrancy risks.
